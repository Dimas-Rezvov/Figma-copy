		Recruiting professionals<br> from Ukraine
	</h3>
	<div class="h3-text">
		Ukraine is one of the most promising IT regions in the world. Every year,<br> institutes produce more and more specialists in the field of information<br> technology. The proximity to the European Union makes our education<br> correspond to the modern level and not yield to the best European universities.<br><br><br><p>

		Unfortunately, the standard of living in our country is still much lower than in<br> the United States, so the salaries of our specialists are much lower than in the<br> US, despite their high qualifications. We want to become a bridge between<br> employers in the USA and Ukrainian specialists. Both sides benefit from such<br> cooperation.</p>
